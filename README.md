# event-forecast
Description
In this project, primary goal was to create an event forecaster, a program that would pull data from both the Ticketmaster API and OpenWeather API to display a list of events, that  when clicked on, will give general weather information for a given day!

Dates for this project were selected and formatted using DayJS!

The main focus of this project was combining two server-side APIS, which I believe we accomplished relatively seamlessly!

We decided to use Bulma for our CSS Framework and it allowed us to implement formatting, dropdowns, boxes, and pagination!

For the OpenWeather API, we ended up having to use two separate API call links and also using internal logic to determine which way the weather would go! 

For the Tickermater Discovery API, we used global variables for the different dates to set up the timeframe for the call then would append all items to the list on the page using JQuery DOM traversal.

This project for all of us was the first collaborative coding effort, so it was a fantastic learning experience for working in a team, merging conflicts and just overall understanding GitHub's group functionality!
